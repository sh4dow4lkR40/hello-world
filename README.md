Hello Humans! 
Sh4dow4lkR40 (AV) here! Merely writing these bits of words as a functional test. I enjoy writing code in Objective-C, Java, and (recently) Apple's new, efficient, and highly praised "Swift" programming language. Pizza and Mountain Dew Voltage are BOOM! Like a Sonic Assault a side step from ya. Well, enough of that. I leave now with this thought: "I cannot think of a better goal than to celebrate freedom!" ok PEACE!! return 0; 
}
